Start socat with the following command:

socat -d -d -d pty,b9600,echo=1,raw,csize=3,ispeed=9600,ospeed=9600,user=poltsi pty,b9600,echo=1,raw,csize=3,ispeed=9600,ospeed=9600,user=poltsi

Observe which pts's it connects to, and after that you can fire up the emulator in another terminal with the command:

./sentinel_serial_emulator.pl /dev/pts/<pts id>

Note that if the emulator starts to complain about 'Unknown command P' continuously then you need to restart the emulator, switching the pts to the other one.
